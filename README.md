Abnormal Behaviour Detection 
Crowd Monitoring: Abnormal Behaviour Detection (In Progress)
  This project applied computer vision and pattern recognition methods aimed to detect abnormal behaved object in crowd, such as runner (fast motion) in a crowd of walking (slow motion) people.
  - Based on: Python, OpenCV, Scikit-Learn and Keras(Tensorflow Backend)
  - Feature extraction: Morphological filter, Normalisation, Optical Flow
  - Classification Model: Fisher, Clustering, CNN
